# question
Test the precision of floating point numbers
* Try and find some floating point numbers and perform some arithmetic operations on them. Show that the operations are not precise due to the choice of the numbers.

* Be careful with the output. You may need to see the exact binary presentation of the float to proof that itâ€™s a floating point precision problem.

* The following code can show the binary presentation of a float in some mainstream architecture.

# solution
see example.cpp
> the float meet IEEE754 standard
